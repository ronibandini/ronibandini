- 👋 I’m @ronibandini from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
- 👀 I'm the founder of the Contracultura Maker initiative (machines of an absurd nature and seditious purposes as a detour, a potlatch, and an exploration of disturbance)
- 🤖 I work with AI (Edge Machine Learning, IAG, LLMs) 
- 💞️ I use Python, C++, PHP, SQL, old tales, Tango moves and 3d modeling.
- 📫 For Maker or AI talks, code customizations, interesting AI projects or questions you can reach me at @RoniBandini
